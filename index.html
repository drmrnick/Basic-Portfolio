    Hello world, my name is Nick tuttle and I am taking a coding class at UNCC. I decided to take
    this class because I wanted to learn the back end of building apps & websites. I have taken graphic
    design classes at a communtity college. I have learned photoshop and illusrator. I have taken on
    a few small jobs for grpahic design in Pennsylvaia, but there I have not found anything that I can
    rely on for work. So I have decided to move to Charlotte, NC to see what can happen. 
       
        Thats when one day I was on reddit and I came accrosss and add for this bootcamp. I looked into it, did some research
    on jobs in the field, attended and open house, and decided to give it a try. I got a new job that
    I can have more flexable hours with and I am excited to see where this program can take me. I hope
    to learn a lot from this and hope to keep working and building ideas and concepts and bring them to
    life. I hope one day I can run my own buisness to reach out to small company's and be able to run
    thier social media pages, and develop apps for the to help with return customers and create a
    stronger customer base and increase revenve for them.
